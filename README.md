# QTM350 Final Project

## Overview

The QTM350 Final Project aims to analyze global population health trends from 1990 to 2023. The project focuses on three key health indicators: life expectancy, under-5 mortality rate, and adolescent fertility rate. By examining these indicators across seven major global regions, the project seeks to identify patterns of improvement and the factors contributing to these changes.

## Project Structure

- **scripts/QTM_350_Final_Project.qmd**: Contains the main analysis and findings, including sections for introduction, data description, data analysis, and visualizations using Python code chunks.
  
- **scripts/new_analysis.qmd**: Intended for additional analysis related to the project, including new findings, visualizations, or supplementary information that complements the main project.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git, such as temporary files and logs.

- **README.md**: Provides documentation for the project, including an overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

- **_quarto.yml**: Configuration file for Quarto, specifying project settings and output formats for rendering the project as HTML.
