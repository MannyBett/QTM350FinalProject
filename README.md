# QTM350 Final Project

## Overview

The QTM350 Final Project explores global population health trends from 1990 to 2023, focusing on three critical health indicators: **life expectancy**, **under-5 mortality rate**, and **adolescent fertility rate**. By analyzing these indicators across seven major global regions, the project aims to:

1. Identify patterns of improvement in population health.
2. Understand the factors contributing to these changes.
3. Examine the relationships between reductions in under-5 mortality, adolescent fertility, and improvements in life expectancy.

This project leverages publicly available World Bank data and uses Python for data analysis, visualization, and reporting. The findings are presented in both HTML and PDF formats, making them accessible for a wide audience.

- **`data/`**: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets used for analysis.
- **`scripts/`**: Includes Python and SQL scripts, split into parts, for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **`documentation/`**: Contains the main Quarto file and the rendered outputs (HTML and PDF reports).
- **`figures/`**: Stores all generated figures and tables used in the analysis.
